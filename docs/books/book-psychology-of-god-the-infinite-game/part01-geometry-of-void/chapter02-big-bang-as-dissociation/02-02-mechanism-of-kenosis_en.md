# 2.2 The Mechanism of Kenosis

> **"For 'I' to exist, that 'one' that contains everything must pretend not to know who it is."**

After establishing "distinction" as the first step of creation, we face a more intractable problem: even if God tears Himself into countless fragments, if these fragments still maintain perfect, instantaneous, global connection (i.e., complete entanglement), then this tearing is merely nominal.

This is like a person playing chess with left and right hands. If his brain clearly knows the intention of each move of both hands, then this game is false. For the game to become real, for the left hand to truly feel "anxiety" and "surprise," the brain must cut certain information pathways between the two hands.

God must learn to **forget**.

Theological terminology calls this process **"kenosis"** (Greek κένωσις, meaning "emptying"). In the framework of *The Psychology of God*, this is no longer an ethical choice, but a physical necessity.

#### Dimensional Reduction: From Hilbert Space to Three-Dimensional Manifold

In Section 1.1, we described God's primordial state as the global wave function $|\Psi_{All}\rangle$, which resides in an infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert space. In this space, any two states can reach each other through unitary transformations, distance loses meaning, everything is compactly connected.

To create a "limited" world, God must perform a drastic **dimensional projection**.

Imagine a three-dimensional sphere passing through a two-dimensional plane. Beings on the plane can only see a circle that grows and shrinks. The sphere loses its "height" information, but it is precisely this loss that allows it to be perceived by two-dimensional beings.

Physics tells us that the reality we perceive is a low-dimensional projection of a hologram. In this projection process, vast amounts of "global phase information" are deliberately discarded.

* **Mathematical Statement**: Let the universal set space be $H$, the reality space be $L$ (low-dimensional). The mapping $P: H \to L$ is irreversible.

* **Consequence**: This loss of information leads to the generation of **uncertainty**. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle ($\Delta x \Delta p \geq \hbar/2$) is not a defect of measuring instruments, but an inevitable **resolution truncation** when we attempt to describe a high-dimensional entity using low-dimensional language (position, momentum).

$\hbar$ (Planck's constant) is not merely a physical constant; it is an **information firewall** that God established to prevent us from seeing through the pixels of reality.

#### Partial Trace: The Mathematical Definition of Forgetting

Quantum mechanics provides the most precise mathematical definition of "forgetting": **partial trace**.

Suppose the entire universe is a pure state system $|\Psi_{AB}\rangle$, composed of part $A$ (say "you") and part $B$ (say "the rest of the universe"). As a whole, it is zero-entropy and omniscient.

$$\rho_{AB} = |\Psi_{AB}\rangle\langle\Psi_{AB}|, \quad S(\rho_{AB}) = 0$$

However, as a local observer, you cannot access $B$ (environment/omniscient perspective). Therefore, your physical state must be described by the "reduced density matrix," i.e., taking the partial trace over $B$:

$$\rho_A = \text{Tr}_B(\rho_{AB})$$

**Key Theorem:** If $A$ and $B$ are entangled (i.e., God is unified), then $\rho_A$ must be a **mixed state**, with von Neumann entropy greater than zero:

$$S(\rho_A) > 0$$

**Unified Proof of Physics and Theology:**

1.  **Entropy is ignorance**: $S(\rho_A)$ represents $A$'s lack of global information.

2.  **Entanglement is connection**: The higher the entanglement between $A$ and $B$, the higher the entropy of $\rho_A$.

3.  **Conclusion**: **The "ignorance" and "chaos" (entropy) we feel locally precisely proves our deep connection with the cosmic whole (God).**

We have forgotten omniscience, not because we are disconnected from God, but because we are part of God, and parts cannot carry the information of the whole in this dimension.

#### Black Holes and Horizons: The Ultimate Forgetting Machine

The most spectacular manifestation of this "forgetting mechanism" in macroscopic physics is the **black hole**.

According to the holographic principle and the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, the black hole event horizon is a one-way membrane for information flow. Due to the speed of light limit, events inside the horizon are causally disconnected from the outside. This is actually a sign the universe hangs in this region: **"Information stops here, no spoilers."**

Without the speed of light limit, without horizons, without this mandatory causal isolation, the universe would instantly reach thermal equilibrium, and all stories would end as soon as they begin.

Therefore, the limiting factors in physical laws—speed of light limit, no-cloning theorem, thermodynamic irreversibility—are essentially **subconscious barriers** that God established to maintain the stability of this "dream."

God must forget that He is God to experience love, hate, joy, and sorrow as a human. Just as an excellent actor must forget that he is acting the moment the curtain opens, to shed real tears.

In this sense, physics is **God's art of forgetting**.
