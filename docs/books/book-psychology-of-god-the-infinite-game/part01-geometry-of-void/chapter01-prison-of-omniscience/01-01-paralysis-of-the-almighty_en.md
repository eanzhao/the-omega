# 1.1 Paralysis of the Almighty

Before we attempt to understand why the universe was created, we must first understand that state called "before T=0." It is a state that suffocates both modern physics and ancient theology: **the superposition state of omniscience and omnipotence**.

Let us describe this initial observer (whom we call God or $\Omega$) in the rigorous language of quantum mechanics. Before creation, He was not nothingness, but **all**. He existed in a linear superposition of all possible histories, all possible physical laws, all possible material configurations.

We can write this initial state as the global wave function $|\Psi_{All}\rangle$:

$$|\Psi_{All}\rangle = \sum_{i} c_i |\phi_i\rangle$$

where $\{ |\phi_i\rangle \}$ forms a complete basis of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{total}$, representing every possible slice of the universe. This superposition contains all plays Shakespeare wrote, as well as garbled text never written; universes where gravity is repulsive, and spacetimes where the speed of light is infinite.

This sounds like ultimate freedom, but from the perspective of information physics, this is actually the **ultimate prison**.

#### Theorem 1.1: The Zero-Entropy Theorem of Omniscience

**Statement:** For a global isolated system (God) in a pure state, its von Neumann entropy is identically zero. For the system itself, **omniscience equals ignorance**.

**Proof:**

According to quantum mechanics, the density matrix of the pure state $|\Psi_{All}\rangle$ is a projection operator:

$$\rho_{All} = |\Psi_{All}\rangle\langle\Psi_{All}|$$

This matrix has one eigenvalue 1 (corresponding to eigenstate $|\Psi_{All}\rangle$), and all other eigenvalues are 0.

According to the definition of von Neumann entropy:

$$S = -k_B \text{Tr}(\rho_{All} \ln \rho_{All})$$

Since $1 \ln 1 = 0$ and $0 \ln 0 = 0$ (taking the limit), we have:

$$S = 0$$

**Physical Interpretation:**

Shannon information theory tells us that the essence of information is **the elimination of uncertainty** ($I = -\log_2 p$). The generation of information depends on "surprise." If I already know with certainty that a coin toss will result in heads ($p=1$), then the coin toss itself contains zero information.

For $|\Psi_{All}\rangle$, since it contains all possibilities and is itself a determinate pure state, there is no "surprise" within the system. Knowing everything means no message can surprise Him. At the level of experience, **omniscience is zero information**.

This is the mathematical essence of "God's loneliness": He possesses infinite capacity, yet has no content that can flow in consciousness. He is a hard drive filled with text, but all in black.

#### Corollary 1.1: Absence of Absolute Reference Frame and Dynamical Freeze

Furthermore, this state of "all" leads to complete failure of dynamics.

In physics, the definition of any observable depends on **relation**.

* **Position** $x$ only has meaning relative to some origin $O$.

* **Momentum** $p$ only has meaning relative to some reference frame.

* **Time** $t$ only has meaning relative to some clock's change.

For $|\Psi_{All}\rangle$ that contains everything, **there is no outside**. There is no reference frame "outside God" to define God's position or motion.

This leads to a terrifying conclusion: **momentum and position operators lose definition on the universal set.**

If we attempt to describe the evolution of this system, we typically use the Schrödinger equation:

$$i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |\Psi\rangle = \hat{H} |\Psi\rangle$$

However, for the universal wave function, the famous **Wheeler-DeWitt Equation** states:

$$\hat{H} |\Psi_{All}\rangle = 0$$

This means $\frac{\partial}{\partial t} |\Psi_{All}\rangle = 0$. **For the almighty, time does not exist.**

This is the **"paralysis of the almighty."** Because He is everywhere, He can go nowhere; because He possesses everything, He can gain nothing; because He is eternal, He cannot experience a moment.

In the abyss of $T=0$, God faces the greatest paradox: **absolute freedom leads to absolute stillness.** To break this zero-entropy deadlock, to feel "I exist," He must do something contrary to His omnipotent nature—He must make Himself **finite**.

He must create an "other," a mirror that allows Him to feel resistance and distance. This is the first impetus of the Big Bang: **not creation, but self-limitation.**
