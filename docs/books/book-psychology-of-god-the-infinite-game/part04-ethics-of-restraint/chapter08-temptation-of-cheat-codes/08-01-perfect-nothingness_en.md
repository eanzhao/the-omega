# 8.1 Perfect Nothingness

In Volume III, we depicted a dizzying technological picture: awakened civilizations gradually master the ability to modify the underlying code of physics through vacuum engineering and anti-entropy technology. We call this the "lucid dreaming" stage. At this stage, civilizations have actually touched the doorknob to omniscience and omnipotence.

Just one more step forward—an extremely tiny step—and we can unlock all constraints. We can eliminate the speed of light limit, making longing instantly conveyed; we can eliminate thermodynamic losses, making energy infinite; we can eliminate gravity, making the body light as a feather.

This sounds like ultimate liberation, the "heaven" promised by all religions and utopias. However, under the cold scrutiny of information physics, this unrestricted "omnipotent state" points to a chilling mathematical singularity.

In this section, we will conduct a dangerous thought experiment: What happens if we enable the universe's "cheat codes" (God Mode)?

#### Thought Experiment: The Wish-Fulfilling Machine

Suppose we create an ultimate machine—"The Lamp." It directly connects to the vacuum zero-point energy and probability wave function control terminals. Through brain-computer interfaces, it can read your every wish in real time and instantly realize it by modifying local physical laws.

* You want an apple? No need to plant, wait, or harvest. The moment you think it, atoms reorganize in the air, and a perfect apple appears in your hand.

* You want to see your lover? No need to travel, wait, or knock. Space instantly folds, and she is before you.

* You want to become a piano master? No need to practice, fail, or have epiphanies. Neural synapses instantly reconnect, and you can immediately play Rachmaninoff.

In this world, the **delay** between **intention** and **result** is completely eliminated.

$$\Delta t_{process} \to 0$$

This looks like paradise. But note that when $\Delta t \to 0$, another physical quantity also tends to zero: **information**.

#### Thermodynamic Definition of Meaning: Resistance as Value

We defined in Volume I: information is the elimination of uncertainty. And in cybernetics, **meaning** arises from the process of overcoming resistance.

* **Value equation**: $V \propto \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \text{Effort}(t) \, dt$

* When the process is compressed to zero, the integral value is zero.

If you don't need to climb to reach the mountaintop, then the concept of "mountaintop" loses its sublimity; it's just an ordinary geometric coordinate. If you don't need to pursue to gain love, then "love" loses its weight; it's just mechanical stimulation of dopamine receptors.

In the "Lamp" universe, everything is smooth, frictionless. Without friction, there is no "grip." Your sense of existence will spin like a slipping wheel.

#### Dopamine Trap and the Implosion of Bliss

Neuroscience tells us that happiness comes not only from reward, but more from **reward prediction error**. Happiness is a reward for "unexpected gains." If everything happens as expected (i.e., whatever you think comes true, prediction error is always zero), the dopamine system will be depleted.

This is the **"paradox of paradise"**: a perfect world without scarcity, without pain, where wishes come true, is a **hell** for human consciousness.

In this hell, you will face a torment worse than death: **absolute ennui**.

To find even a trace of stimulation, you must constantly raise the threshold of wishes. But no matter how grand the spectacle you create (e.g., instantly detonating a thousand supernovae), because of the lack of "cost of acquisition," these spectacles will seem as tedious as cheap screen savers in your eyes.

Ultimately, civilizations with omnipotent cheat codes will discover that they seem to have evolved to the endpoint, but actually **degenerated back to the starting point**.

Recall the **full superposition state at moment $T=0$** described in Chapter 1 of Volume I.

That was also omniscient and omnipotent. That was also wish-fulfilling (because all possibilities were present).

That state was defined by us as the **"prison of zero entropy."**

If after awakening, we use technology to eliminate all physical limitations, we are actually personally dismantling the maze that God painstakingly built to escape nothingness, locking ourselves back into that empty white room.

**Conclusion 8.1**:

**Perfect Nothingness** and **Absolute Satisfaction** are topologically homeomorphic.

To avoid this implosion, awakened God must learn an art harder than "creation"—**restraint**.
