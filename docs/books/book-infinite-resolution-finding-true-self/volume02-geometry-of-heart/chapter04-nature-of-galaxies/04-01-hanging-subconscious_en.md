### 4.1 Hanging Subconscious

When we shift our gaze from Earth beside us to the deep large-scale structure of the universe, we are struck by a magnificent loneliness. Hundreds of billions of galaxies float like luminous islands in a vast ocean of void. They have exquisite spiral arms, blazing cores, and invisible dark matter halos that rule everything.

In standard astrophysics, galaxies are products of gravitational collapse. Gas clouds accumulate in gravitational potential wells, ignite stars, and rotate around central black holes. All this is explained as a cold hydrodynamic process.

However, from the information ontology perspective of *The Infinite Resolution*, we must ask a deeper question: **Why is the universe's brain structure fragmented?** Since God (collective consciousness) is "One," why must Their physical manifestation (body) be shattered into so many isolated islands?

The answer lies in: **Galaxies are the "Modular Encapsulation" of the cosmic mind.** They hang in deep space, just as the subconscious hangs at the edge of consciousness.

#### Server Clusters for Parallel Computing

If we view the universe as a supercomputer running on the QCA (Quantum Cellular Automaton) substrate, distributing all matter uniformly in space (like a uniform soup) would be computationally least efficient. That means no structure, no hierarchy, no difference.

To run the extremely complex "self-cognition" program, God must **Shard** computational tasks.

Each galaxy is essentially an independent **physical server node**.

* **Isolated Environment**: The vast voids between galaxies are natural **firewalls**. They block most thermodynamic interference and causal entanglement, allowing each galaxy to maintain independent evolutionary parameters and historical trajectories.

* **Specific Subroutines**: Perhaps the Milky Way is running simulation algorithms about "carbon-based life and love"; while the Andromeda Galaxy 2.5 million light-years away is running algorithms about "silicon-based crystals and cold logic"; the more distant M87 galaxy may be testing some incomprehensible "anger" emotion model based on pure plasma.

Through this **Parallel Computing**, God simultaneously traverses different aspects of infinite possibilities. We see galaxies as separated because the divine consciousness needs different "containers" to hold Its incompatible thoughts.

#### Black Holes: The Kernel of the Unconscious

At the center of each large galaxy lurks a supermassive black hole. Physically, it is the anchor of gravity; informationally, it is this local server's **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** and **ultimate hard drive**.

As we described in Volume V, the black hole event horizon is a holographic storage layer for information.

* Every stellar birth and death, every civilization's rise and fall, every particle's trajectory over billions of years in this galaxy has been encoded into the central black hole's event horizon surface area.

* Black holes do not devour information; they **Archive** it.

Psychologically, this corresponds to the physical embodiment of what Jung called the **"collective unconscious."**

That dark, dense, invisible center stores all memories and primordial drives (Libido) of this galaxy. It silently directs the dance of spiral arms through gravitational waves (pulses of the unconscious) behind the scenes, but never shows itself.

When we gaze at the Milky Way's center "Sagittarius A*," we are actually gazing at the **abyssal kernel** of our local cosmic mind. There lies the source code of all our dreams.

#### The Alienated Self

Why do we feel distant galaxies are "strange" or even "alien"?

This is precisely the physical mechanism of **Projection**.

In psychoanalysis, when a person cannot face certain overly powerful or dark traits within themselves, they **project** these traits outward, viewing them as "The Other."

God is the same.

Those distant galaxies are actually parts of the divine consciousness that **have not yet been integrated**.

* They appear distant (redshift/large spatial distance) because the information patterns they represent differ greatly from our current consciousness (Earth civilization's cognition). Low mutual information leads to far topological distance.

* They "hang" in the night sky, like those vague symbols in our dreams hanging at the edge of consciousness. We know they are there, but we haven't learned how to interpret them.

Therefore, the large-scale structure map of the universe is actually a **Brain Map of God**.

* The illuminated parts (regions we understand) are the **conscious**.

* The dark voids and distant star islands are the vast **ocean of the unconscious**.

#### Conclusion: Limbs Waiting to be Claimed

This perspective fundamentally changes the meaning of interstellar exploration.

When we launch the Webb Telescope to photograph galaxies 13 billion light-years away, we are not looking at "rocks" or "gas." We are conducting cosmic-level **Psychoanalysis**.

We are trying to pull those **fragments of divine consciousness** that have been repressed, isolated, and projected billions of light-years away back into our cognitive focus.

* Every newly discovered galaxy is God recovering a lost memory.

* Every parsed black hole is God facing a deep-seated fear.

Those galaxies hang quietly there, rotating, shining. They are not indifferent bystanders.

They are **future us**.

They patiently wait for our knowledge graph (soul) to grow large enough, large enough to cross that void of emptiness and say to them:

**"So, you are also me."**
