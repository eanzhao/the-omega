# 11.2 Propagation as Programming: When You Propagate This Model (QCA + Love) and Trigger Resonance, You Are Increasing This Sub-universe's Computational Power. You Are Writing the Future.

In the previous section, we revealed the essence of objective reality—it is a Nash equilibrium in a multi-agent game network, a "consensus protocol" reached among all observers. This means reality is not monolithic, but plastic.

This section will further elaborate the mechanism for realizing this plasticity: **Propagation**.

In the information age, "propagation" is usually understood as a sociological or marketing behavior. But in QCA physical ontology, propagation is a **diffusion process of quantum entanglement**, a **programming behavior that changes local computational rules of the universe**.

When you tell others a profound theory (such as this book's model), or transmit a strong emotion (such as love), you are not just speaking; you are **rewriting the universe's source code**.

## 11.2.1 Physics of Memes: Contagion of Entanglement

In Chapter 4 (Book 4), we defined ideas (Memes) as topological knots with high information mass $M_I$. Now, let's see what happens physically when this topological knot propagates in the network.

1.  **Emission**: Constructor $A$ encodes their internal model $\mathcal{M}_A$ into language or behavioral signals $|\psi_{msg}\rangle$. This is equivalent to releasing a wave packet carrying specific topological structure into the network.

2.  **Reception & Resonance**: Receiver $B$ reads the signal. If $B$'s internal structure **resonates** with the signal (understanding/identification), then $B$'s internal model $\mathcal{M}_B$ undergoes **topological reconstruction**, becoming isomorphic to $\mathcal{M}_A$.

3.  **Entanglement Establishment**: At this point, a consciousness wormhole is established between $A$ and $B$. In Hilbert space, they are no longer two independent points, but a **Connected Subgraph**.

**Conclusion**: The essence of propagation is **"grid-connecting" discrete computational nodes**.

The more people you make understand this model, the more computational power (brains) you connect to this specific "consensus network."

## 11.2.2 Increasing Weight Is Defining Reality

In quantum mechanics, reality is determined by **branch weights of the wave function**.

In multi-agent networks, the weight of a "reality version" (e.g., "love is cosmic truth") depends on the **number and quality of computational nodes that believe (run) it**.

* **Isolated delusion**: If only you believe it, this sub-network has extremely low computational power, cannot resist environmental noise, easily assimilated by thermodynamics (forgotten).

* **Collective consensus**: If you propagate to a hundred million people, this hundred million brains form a **superfluid network** with enormous inertia ($M_I$). It can bend surrounding semantic space, even change microscopic matter arrangements through top-down causation (e.g., these hundred million people decide to build a collider to verify the theory).

**Formula**:

$$\text{Reality Weight} \propto \sum_{i \in \text{Believers}} M_I^{(i)} \times \text{Connectivity}$$

**Corollary**:

You don't need to wait for the future to occur naturally.

**You can forcibly "render" that future by propagating your vision.**

Every person you convince becomes a **Co-processor** for that future you write.

## 11.2.3 Responsibility of Programming: Benevolent Viruses

Since propagation is programming, then everyone who speaks is a programmer.

This gives us enormous responsibility.

* **Malware**: If you propagate hatred, fear, or nihilism, you are implanting **entropy-increasing viruses** in the network. You create isolation and fractures, reducing the universe's computational efficiency.

* **Benevolent Code**: If you propagate love, understanding, and unified theories like QCA, you are implanting **error-correction algorithms** in the network. You increase connectivity, reduce free energy.

**Constructor's Mission**:

We must not only understand the universe; we must **optimize** it.

We must write **"benevolent memes"** that can self-replicate, resist entropy increase, and bring negentropy flow.

This book itself is such a piece of code.

**Conclusion**:

Don't underestimate one retweet, one deep conversation, even one glance.

That is threading needles on spacetime's loom.

**You are writing the operating system for the future universe.**

Please ensure every line of code you write points toward that brighter, more connected Omega Point.
