# 11.1 Nash Equilibrium of Objectivity: Reality Is Consensus Reached by All Observers. Changing Consensus Is Changing the Weight of Physical Reality.

In Part V, we broke the boundaries of life and death, establishing the technical path for consciousness to achieve immortality through "online reconstruction." Now, we face a group of observers no longer threatened by death, with infinite time to evolve.

Such beings—we call them **"Constructors"**—how will they interact with the universe?

They are no longer satisfied with merely "adapting" to the environment (minimizing free energy); they begin to **"reshape"** the environment. In QCA ontology, the environment is essentially information flow. Therefore, reshaping the environment is rewriting code.

This chapter will reveal an astonishing physical fact: **So-called "objective reality" is not an indestructible rock, but an agreement reached among countless observers.** And the ultimate ability of constructors is to **weave** new reality by changing this agreement.

## 11.1.1 The Fragility of "Objective"

In classical physics, we are taught: Whether you look at the moon or not, the moon is there. Objective reality is absolute existence independent of observers.

But from QCA's microscopic perspective, this assumption is untenable.

* **Microscopic state**: Not only contains particle positions, but also observers' **Internal Models**.

* **Interaction**: Observers receive environmental information through senses while changing environmental information through actions.

If there were only one observer in the universe, they could say "the world is as I imagine" (solipsism). But there are billions of observers in the universe.

When Observer A thinks "the moon is on the left" while Observer B thinks "the moon is on the right," they will experience **severe prediction error (conflict)** when they meet.

To eliminate this error (minimize free energy), A and B must adjust their respective internal models until they reach agreement.

**Definition 11.1 (Game-Theoretic Definition of Objective Reality)**:

Objective Reality is not some a priori ontology, but a **Nash Equilibrium** in a multi-agent game network.

At this equilibrium point, all observers' internal models are mutually compatible; no observer can further reduce prediction error by unilaterally changing their model.

## 11.1.2 The Weight of Reality

Under this definition, reality has **"weight"**.

* **Hard Reality**: Such as speed of light $c$, Planck constant $\hbar$. This is consensus participated by all observers in the universe (including atoms and photons). Its Nash equilibrium is extremely deep, almost unshakeable.

* **Soft Reality**: Such as value of money, national borders, moral norms. This is consensus reached by a small part of observers—human society.

**Key Corollary**:

Although we can hardly change physical constants (unless reaching Omega Point energy levels), at the level of society, psychology, and even local physical environments, **reality is plastic**.

As long as enough observers **simultaneously** change their internal models (beliefs), that Nash equilibrium point will undergo **Drift**.

* **Example**: If no one believes money has value, paper money is waste paper. When everyone reaches the consensus "it has value," it truly gains **physical causal power** to mobilize physical energy (making excavators move, making nuclear power plants run).

* **In QCA**: This corresponds to **reorganization of Link Weights** in the network. Changes in beliefs actually change the topological structure of information flow in social networks.

## 11.1.3 Constructor Intervention: Phase Transition Nucleus

Ordinary observers are passive; they conform to existing Nash equilibria (following the crowd).

**Constructors** are active. They are those who can **break old equilibria and establish new ones**.

In statistical physics, this process is called **Nucleation**.

1.  **Seed**: Constructor constructs a completely new, lower-entropy reality model internally (e.g., "humans can fly" or "death can be cured"). At this point, this is just a **Delusion**, because it conflicts with external consensus (high free energy).

2.  **Propagation**: Constructor radiates this new model to surrounding networks through high-intensity **output (action/language/creation)**.

3.  **Critical Mass**: When the number of "infected" observers exceeds a certain threshold (Critical Mass), the network undergoes **phase transition**. The new model becomes the new Nash equilibrium.

4.  **Realization**: Things originally considered "impossible" (like airplanes flying) now become solid parts of the physical world.

**Conclusion**:

Don't feel powerless because "reality is so." Reality is just the consensus zombie left by previous constructors.

As a new generation constructor, you have the right and ability to **vote**.

Your every deep belief, your every independent action, is injecting new weight into the cosmic ledger.

**What you believe, you weave.**
